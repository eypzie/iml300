      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/eilythia.penati/sketches/ZqtWEid1s">WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY</a>
        <p> This project is based on a podcast I did last year about beauty standards. I wanted to create a space where I could talk with some people about their experience with beauty standards and body image throughout their life. The words in the background is one of my favorite quotes from the podcast that I felt represents what we were talking about. I also wanted to utilize the sound input through screaming because the podcast is called when you are angry.</p>
      
      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a href="https://eilythia-ghost.glitch.me/">ghost</a>
        <p> My project is called “ghost”. I wanted to capture the feeling of starting to trust someone new in a relationship or friendship. I thought this would be interesting to capture through a dream/nightmare-like project because I feel like often when this happens I can get in my own head about how relationships are going, it can almost feel like I am talking to two versions of myself.  I did a photo/video shoot with my friends Ginger and Emiko and then turned the photos into a gif. I tried to use motion blur to show that it was in a dream and I tried to utilize aspects that could appear and disappear to show to symbolize a ghost-like image. I really enjoy websites and projects that have hidden aspects where if an audience member really enjoyed it they will continue to look at it and find new things each time. I tried to do that with this project with some more “hidden” pages and words. I hope you enjoy it! </p>
