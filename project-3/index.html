            WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY is a vizualized podcast </div> that focuses on the female experience, and how it can be angering growing up with societal expectations that are put on you just because you are a woman. Currently, WYAA is highlighting subtle and mundane topics that are often overlooked in our society and not pierced together as something that is repressive towards women.</p> <p>WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY hopes to create a community of women and a safe and open space where everyone feels comfortable talking about stories and moments surrounding womanhood. After reflecting on the podcast, there will be an art piece created based on each episode that will be released.
